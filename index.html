                    <p>i have been learning photoshop as a hobby. all i studied beside youtube videos was one tiny course but i was making a lot of different projects for myself (at first most of them weren't good) and now if you like my arts you can ask me to do something for you and if you will like it tou could pay for it and i will send you a hight resolution foto and if you want psd file
                        <br>! warning !
